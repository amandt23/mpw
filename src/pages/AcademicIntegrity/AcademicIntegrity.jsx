                        <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                        <p>In-house essay writers are referred to as “My Perfect Writing Limited Experts” or “Writing Experts” by the company. These writers are part of the company’s professional writing and editing staff.
                            Customers or Clients are those whom My Perfect Writing Limited welcomes to either visit the website or use the platform's free tools and samples of academic assignments for help.
                            Professional writers are referred to individuals who help the company with the writing service. The Writing Service could be offered to the Customer for a limited period and under certain conditions.
                            Delivering is referred to as a finished product exchanged with a customer in return for money. It can be an essay, a report, a term paper, a dissertation, or something else different. There are a variety of ways that assignments may be presented, including via audio/visual media and creative writing.
                            The product of our custom essay writing service is the client's final, approved draft sent when payment is made. There is a sample of the client’s academic assignment included in the materials. It’s not designed to be submitted to any state-chartered, incorporated, licensed, registered, or monitored university, college, academy, school, or other educational institution for the purpose of earning credit toward a degree, diploma, certificate, or course of study.</p>

                        <h3>GENERAL <br />
                            AT MY PERFECT WRITING, WE'VE ADOPTED A CUSTOMISED LEARNING TECHNIQUE TO MAKE THINGS SIMPLER FOR OUR HARDWORKING STUDENTS.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Here we have outlined the expectations we have for the customers who choose our essay writing service.

                            My Perfect Writing Limited declares that it views the trafficking of academic materials as damaging to students, the academic community, and the general public. My Perfect Writing Limited's website does not advocate for such behaviour.
                            You are not permitted to ask our writers to help you plagiarise in any academic setting. Helping a student pass a course or get a degree by submitting a paper, thesis, or dissertation that is not the student's own constitutes academic dishonesty.
                            Professional writers at My Perfect Writing Limited are not allowed to aid customers who request help in breaking any kind of school rules. One example is helping a student with a graded assignment or a test. If it is found that one of our writing experts has been helping a student cheat, that person will be dismissed immediately.

                            <h2>ORDER PLACING AND ORDER PROCESS</h2>
                            <p>The Order is placed by completing the Order form provided on the Website. No Service is provided by other means than by request.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Order form will specify the scope of the work, Order parameters, and delivery terms. It is your responsibility to provide exact, complete, and final information in each standard Order form section when filling it out. You are obligated to ensure that the information given in the Order is presented in a form that allows the Expert to provide you with a correct Product.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Company reserves the right to re-evaluate the Order details following the final payment to confirm whether the assignment requirements were met successfully, as indicated by the Customer. Should a mismatch occur, Support reserves the right to modify the Order to ensure that the Customer's requirements have been adhered to.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>Each Order placed by the Customer has a required volume, measured by the number of words. Upon the Service delivery, the Product received has to match the expected word sum. Note that the document may have fewer pages than requested but should have an exact number of words according to the &laquo;275 words per double-spaced page or 550 words per single-spaced page&raquo; rule. Should there be a page/number-of-words mismatch, the Customer may request to reformat the Product to match the number of words/pages according to the &laquo;275 words per double-spaced page or 550 words per single-spaced page&raquo; rule. For PowerPoint presentations, 1 slide corresponds to approximately 135 words per slide (text on slide).</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>Customer and Support may provide changes to the scope of work only if the Expert has not started the work yet. No changes can be made once the Expert has started working on the Order. Should the changes in Order details affect the volume of work, Order complexity, or narrow the completion terms, the Customer will be asked to provide additional compensation.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>Should the Customer require any specific materials to be utilized in the production process, they must specify the sources and provide them to the Expert. If the references are not provided, the Expert is responsible for locating them. However, additional charges will be incurred and must be paid before the Expert can begin working on the project.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>In general, the following deadlines for Orders are in place:</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <ul role="list">
                                <li><strong>For Orders due within<em>12-24 hours</em>, the Customer must supply the sources within<em>30 minutes</em>of the Order placement;</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>For Orders due within<em>24-72 hours</em>, within<em>1 hour</em>;</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>For Orders with a<em>72+ hour deadline</em>, sources must be received<em>a day in advance</em>.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>If the Customer did not provide materials within the deadline, extra payment and/or time for completing the Order would be required. The Company is not responsible if the Order's instructions were changed or incorrect in the first place. If the Customer adds extra materials after the work is delivered, all the funds can be released to the Expert if initial instructions are followed.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Customer is highly encouraged to communicate with the Expert using the Messaging System or contacting the Support team directly when seeking more information. By placing an Order on the Website, the Customer acknowledges that it may take a few hours to get a reply from an Expert.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Customer can track the progress of the Order by using their Personal Account, where information about each Order and its status is displayed. The Customer can also contact Support to request the Order&rsquo;s progress status by using all communication means. The Support Team is available 24/7.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Customer may select a Favorite Expert to work on the Order by indicating their name or ID in the &ldquo;Invite Expert&rdquo; field. The Customer acknowledges that there is no 100% guarantee that the specific Expert is available to work on the Order. However, the Customer reserves the right to assign another Expert from the list of the biddings.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>While ordering the Services, you must not send to the Experts any content which may be considered illegal, unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, violent, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, libelous, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, hateful or racially, sexually, ethnically or otherwise objectionable.</p>
                            <h2>ORDER PAYMENT AND DISCOUNTS</h2>
                            <p>When placing an Order, you agree to pay for the provided Service. The Company starts to process your Order only after the payment for the Service is made and authorized. It is recommended that you use a payment card at least six months before the expiration date.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The payment for the product is calculated based on the Company's pricing and is paid in advance, as stated in the order form, once the scope of work is identified. Additionally, the Customer may be charged a service fee for using the website, which is determined by the Company and depends on the order's complexity, parameters, and other features. The exact amount of the service fee is available to the Customer at the payment stage.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The service fee is non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in these Terms, Refund Policy or other policies, available on our Website (e.g. when the order evaluation is 0%).</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Company will not proceed with the product delivery until full payment has been made and authorized.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>Orders can be paid by funds from your Personal Balance.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Company reserves the right to offer discount and bonus programs to Customers at its discretion. The Customer can use promo code(s) when filling out the Order form. If the code is not provided in the corresponding section of the Order form, the promo code will not apply to the Order being placed.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>The Company commits to providing equal access to discount and bonus program information for each Customer with no exceptions.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>Upon your Order evaluation, the Company may request additional payment or additional time to work on your Order since the volumes of the work to be done to fulfill your requirements can only be defined after a manual review is performed. The Expert determines the final price after the manual review. The Customer may decide at their own will to either agree to new Order parameters and Order Total or refuse to cooperate with the Expert. If the Customer wishes to stop working with Us, a refund will be processed according to the<a href="https://settletogether.com/terms-and-conditions">Refund Policy</a>.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
                            <p>When placing Orders and buying Products from the Company, you can only use Visa, Mastercard, Discover or AmericanExpress cards to recharge your Personal Balance. Should the case of partial or full payment reimbursement occur, you have the option to either proceed according to the<a href="https://settletogether.com/refund-policy">Refund Policy</a>or transfer the funds to your Personal Balance.</p>
                            <p>&zwj;</p>
